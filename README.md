# MQTT-Lab

Welcome to the ESP32 Distance Measurement and LED Control project! In this practice, we utilize two ESP32 boards to create an interactive and visually appealing system.

## Project Description

In this project, one ESP32 acts as a distance sensor using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. This ESP32 measures the distance and sends the information via MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) to another ESP32.

The second ESP32 acts as a receiver, receiving MQTT messages and controlling an 8-LED strip based on the measured distance. The idea is to illuminate the LEDs proportionally to the distance, creating an intuitive visual indicator.
